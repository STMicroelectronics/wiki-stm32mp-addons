Roadmap
#######

TF-M has been under active development since it was launched in Q1'18. It is
being designed to include

1. Secure boot ensuring integrity of runtime images and responsible for firmware upgrade.
2. Runtime firmware consisting of TF-M Core responsible for secure isolation,
   execution and communication aspects. and a set of Secure Services providing
   services to the Non-Secure and Secure Applications. The secures services
   currently supported are Secure Storage, Cryptography, Firmware Update,
   Attestation and Platform Services

If you are interested in collaborating on any of the roadmap features or other
features, please mail TF-M mailing list
