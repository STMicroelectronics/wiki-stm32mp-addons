Devicetree
##########

The Devicetree (DT), is a data structure and language for describing hardware.
More specifically, it is a description of hardware that is readable by an operating system
so that the operating system doesn't need to hard code details of the machine.

For general devicetree information some documentation are available:

* `Devicetree specification <https://www.devicetree.org/>`_
* `Devicetree Usage <https://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Usage>`_
* `Devicetree Reference <https://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Reference>`_

The pages in this section are a high-level guide to using devicetree in TF-M:
